Game info:

How the players stats influence the game:

	attack: the damage taken from battles
	health: if 0, you lose the game
	healing: sometimes a random amount of lost health is regenerated (more with more healing), more likely if more health 		is lost
	intelligence: monsters without pathfinding sometimes avoid fighting you if your intelligence is high enough
	intuition: if your intuition, dexterity and agility are high enough you can sometimes fight monsters without taking any damage
	dexterity: same
	agility: same
	block: the damage taken from battles
	
The different mobs:

	Hunter: weak mob that can chase the player
	Slime: sometimes gains health if not fought and gets strong after a while, moves randomly, sometimes avoids a player with high intelligence
